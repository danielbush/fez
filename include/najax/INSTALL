--------

If you would like to use the Client Event System (NACLES)
you should run the following SQL code in your database:

CREATE TABLE `najax_events`
(
	`id`		BIGINT			UNSIGNED	NOT NULL	AUTO_INCREMENT,
	`event`		VARCHAR(100)				NOT NULL,
	`className`	VARCHAR(100)				NOT NULL,
	`filter`	VARCHAR(100)				NULL,
	`sender`	TEXT						NULL,
	`data`		TEXT						NULL,
	`time`		DOUBLE			UNSIGNED	NOT NULL,
	`endTime`	DOUBLE			UNSIGNED	NOT NULL,

	PRIMARY KEY(`id`),

	INDEX(`event`, `className`, `filter`, `time`, `endTime`)

);

If you're going to use another provider (not MySQL) please refer to
the README or INSTALL file included in it. Note, that some providers
do not require installation.
