<B><A NAME="what">What is UQ eSpace?</A></B><BR>
<A HREF="http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/">UQ eSpace</A> is <A HREF="http://www..uq.edu.au/">The University of Queensland</A>'s institutional digital repository for research and teaching materials. It contains publications and other forms of teaching and research data, including multimedia, image collections and datasets, as well as 'grey' literature such as working papers and technical reports from schools and centres. It stores and showcases the research output of academic staff and postgraduate students (both past and present) at this University. It includes a range of subjects and disciplines. The UQ eSpace server provides free, searchable access to open collections of this research and manages its long-term archiving and preservation.
<P>

<B><A NAME="who">Who can deposit materials in UQ eSpace?</A></B><BR>
Current academic staff and postgraduate students of the University of Queensland may deposit research. Former staff and students who may wish to make use of the service should contact the UQ eSpace Co-ordinator to arrange access. Users need to log in to deposit materials.
<P>

<B><A NAME="how">How do I log in?</A></B><BR>
If you are a current UQ staff member or student, log in with your usual UQ name and password using the  <B>UQ Log in</B> link in <A HREF="http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/">UQ eSpace</A>. Other people, such as <A HREF="#exstaff">retired staff</A> or <A HREF="#exstudents">former students</A>, should contact the <A HREF="#help">UQ eSpace Co-ordinator</A> for information about obtaining a log in. You do not need to log in to browse collections, but you do need to be logged in to create records.
<P>

<B><A NAME="where">Where do I deposit material within <A HREF="http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/">UQ eSpace</A>?</A></B><BR>
Log into <A HREF="http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/">UQ eSpace</A> and then click the <B>My UQ eSpace</B> link on the top right of the screen. Click on <B>Collections</B>. The collection(s) to which you can contribute will be listed.
<P>

<B><A NAME="help">How do I get help?</A></B><BR>
You can read this FAQ or contact the UQ eSpace Co-ordinator for help on +617 3365 8281 or via email to espace AT library.uq.edu.au

<P>
<HR NOSHADE>
<P>



<B><A NAME="owncoll">I want to create my own collection. How do I do that?</A></B><BR>
If you want to set up a new collection, please contact the <A HREF="#help">UQ eSpace Co-ordinator</A>.
<P>

 <B><A NAME="myself">Why can't I set up a collection myself?</A></B><BR>
The permissions to create collections within UQ eSpace communities are currently quite limited. However, please contact the <A HREF="#help">UQ eSpace Co-ordinator</A> to discuss this issue. It is very possible that you could be granted this right.
<P>

 <B><A NAME="which">There seem to be two collections for my school. Which one should I use?</A></B><BR>
In some cases, two (or more) collections may show up in <B>My UQ eSpace</B> when you log in. Suppose you are an academic in the School of English, Media Studies and Art History. One collection you will see will be called <B>Publications of the School of English, Media Studies and Art History</B> and one will be called <B>School of English, Media Studies and Art History</B>. The latter is a closed collection of material set up for one of the current UQ Research Assessment Trials, and contains only materials selected for that trial. The other collection is the open collection for publications of the school. Please deposit your work in the open collection.
<P>

 <B><A NAME="limit">How do I limit access to my work?</A> I only want my research team to see it.</B><BR>
Please contact the <A HREF="#help">UQ eSpace Co-ordinator</A> to arrange this.<P>

 <B><A NAME="fulltext">Do I need to deposit the full text for anything I decide to store in the repository?</A></B><BR>
No. For publications, you can just upload the citation for a publication if you wish. Full text is certainly welcome, but in some cases, copyright restrictions preclude the deposit of publisher versions of published articles, conference papers, book chapters and other publications. In those cases, deposits of 'author' versions of the final refereed work may be permissible. To check the copyright position of the major journal publishers, try consulting <A HREF="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo.php">SHERPA</A>. You can also seek advice from your school or centre liaison librarian or from the <A HREF="#help">UQ eSpace Co-ordinator</A>. <P>
For research datasets, if you do not wish to make all the data openly available, you are welcome to upload descriptions of the data only. This alerts other researchers to the existence of the dataset. Please also provide information on the appropriate person researchers should contact to discuss access. If you are uploading datasets, please also provide information on any tools or software researchers might need to use or manipulate the data.
<P>


 <B><A NAME="models">My work doesn't really fit the available models</A> for my school - it isn't a published article or a book chapter. What do I do?</B><BR>
It is possible to deposit work as a <B>preprint</B> or as a <B>generic document</B>. However, you are welcome to consult the UQ eSpace Co-ordinator about establishing a model for your work.<P>

 <B><A NAME="format">Is there a limit on what formats I can deposit?</A></B><BR>
Open access formats such as Adobe PDF, HTML or PostScript are preferred since users require no expensive software to access them. However, any digital format can be uploaded. If your format is unusual, or requires specific software to run, please state this in the Notes field of the record as users will then know what to do to see and use the work.<P>

 <B><A NAME="filesize">Is there a limit on how large a file I can upload?</A></B><BR>
File upload size is currently set at around 60MB. Any file larger than that may cause the system to reject the record, which may cause your data not to be saved by the system. Please consult the the <A HREF="#help">UQ eSpace Co-ordinator</A> if you have large files to deposit.<P>

 <B><A NAME="attach">Can I attach more than one file to a record?</A></B><BR>
Certainly. For a book chapter, you might want to upload your chapter, the book's table of contents and possibly the cover art (copyright permitting). All those objects (datastreams) will form part of the single record.<P>

 <B><A NAME="clone">Can I clone a record?</A> I used to be able to do this in <A HREF="http://eprint.uq.edu.au/">ePrintsUQ</A>.</B><BR>
Not at the moment. This feature is slated for development and should be available soon. Development information is stored in our <A HREF="http://dev-repo.library.uq.edu.au/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Wiki</A>.<P>

<B><A NAME="webadd">How do I cite the Web address of a work in <A HREF="http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/">UQ eSpace</A>?</A></B><BR>
Works in the repository - whether communities, collections or individual item records - all have unique identifiers in this format: <B>http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:<I>n</B> </I>where <I>n</I> is the work's unique ID within the repository. Use that link for citations. To find an address for a citation, browse to the item you want and copy the URL from the address bar of your browser.
<P>

<B><A NAME="owndep">Can I see my own deposits?</A></B><BR>
We do not currently have a <B>My Documents</B> feature in <A HREF="http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/">UQ eSpace</A>. However this feature is currently under consideration. Please advise the <A HREF="#help">UQ eSpace Co-ordinator</A> if you require this feature. At the moment, your best option is to search on your surname.<P>

<B><A NAME="multimedia">Can I upload multimedia?</A></B><BR>
Yes. We currently have a content model for audio and are working on a model for video. However, multimedia can be uploaded as a generic document since there is no restriction on the number or the formats of items associated with a record. The default option is for audio and video files to be available for download. Audio and video can be offered instead as streaming media if required, but you will need to contact the <A HREF="#help">UQ eSpace Co-ordinator</A> if you require this feature.<P>

 <B><A NAME="RQF">I deposited some information into <A HREF="http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/">UQ eSpace</A> for research assessment trials. Can I use that data again for the upcoming RQF?</A></B><BR>
Very likely. We are looking at the data we currently have with a view to reusing as much as possible for RQF 2008.<P>

 <B><A NAME="blank">My screen just went blank when I tried to deposit a work. What went wrong?</A></B><BR>
There are a number of possibilities. In some cases, using the Internet Explorer browser software can cause this problem. Mozilla Firefox and Netscape work better with <A HREF="http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/">UQ eSpace</A>. In some cases, certain special characters, such as angle brackets, can cause the system to reject the record. Trying to attach a file with spaces in the file name, e.g. UQ eSpace.pdf, will cause a blank screen, as will trying to upload a file over 60MB. Please contact the UQ eSpace Co-ordinator for help if this problem occurs.<P>

 <B><A NAME="moreone">Can a single record belong to more than one collection?</A></B><BR>
Yes. In the record, you can select more than one collection name by holding down the CTRL key when you click the second, third, ... collection names.<P>

<B><A NAME="crawl">Where is the repository content indexed?</A></B><BR>
The content is indexed in major Internet search engines such as <A HREF="http://www.google.com.au/">Google</A>. It is also harvested by services such as <A HREF="http://www.arrow.edu.au/">ARROW</A> and <A HREF="http://oaister.umdl.umich.edu/o/oaister/">OAIster</A>.<P>

<B><A NAME="depeff">Is depositing a lot of work?</A></B><BR>
It should not take more than a minute or two to upload an item. To deposit an item, you need to log in. Navigate to your home collection. Click 'Create' and then select the record type you wish to create, e.g. a journal article, conference paper, book chapter, image and so on. Be sure to choose the right option as this cannot currently be changed after the event. Fill in your data and click 'Submit for Approval'. An editor will then vet your record for completeness and for copyright clearance and make it publicly available.
<P>

 <B><A NAME="invis">Why does something I deposited not show up straightaway?</A></B><BR>
Most work in the repository is checked by an editor before being finally 'published' to the open repository. This check is made to ensure that openly available records are as complete as possible, that no errors have crept in, and that any attached files comply with publisher copyright requirements.<P>

<B><A NAME="older">What about my older papers?</A> Can I deposit material even if it is not currently in electronic form?</B><BR>
Please contact <A HREF="#help">the UQ eSpace Co-ordinator</A> to discuss the digitisation of research materials.
<P>

<B><A NAME="host">Can I host non-UQ material on <A HREF="http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/">UQ eSpace</A>?</A></B><BR>
Please consult <A HREF="#help">the UQ eSpace Co-ordinator</A> to discuss this.<P>

<B><A NAME="exstaff">Can former staff deposit materials?</A></B><BR>
Former academic staff and postgraduate students are welcome to deposit materials in UQ eSpace. Your collection is entitled <A HREF="http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/collection/uq:12339">Papers and Publications of Former UQ Staff and Postgraduate Students</A> and it sits under the community called the <A HREF="http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/community/uq:12338">UQ Community</A>. before you can deposit material, you will need to obtain a UQ eSpace username and password.  This will allow you to log in to your collection. <A HREF="#help">Please contact the UQ eSpace Co-ordinator to arrange this access.</A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="exstudents">Can former students deposit materials?</A></B><BR>
Former academic staff and postgraduate students are welcome to deposit materials in UQ eSpace. Your collection is entitled <A HREF="http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/collection/uq:12339">Papers and Publications of Former UQ Staff and Postgraduate Students</A> and it sits under the community called the <A HREF="http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/community/uq:12338">UQ Community</A>. Before you can deposit material, you will need to obtain a UQ eSpace username and password. This will allow you to log in to your collection. <A HREF="#help">Please contact the UQ eSpace Co-ordinator to arrange this access.</A><P>

<HR NOSHADE>
<P>


<B><A NAME="downloads">Can I get figures on how often my papers are being downloaded?</A></B><BR>
Yes, there are statistics provided on the web site. You can see statistics on the Top 50 papers and the Top 50 authors. The figures are broken up into Full Downloads and Abstract Views. The figures are updated overnight, not in real time. Downloads per item are listed as part of an individual item view.
<P>

 <B><A NAME="wheredown">Where are my download statistics?</A></B><BR>
Download statistics per item are stored with the item, rather than with your name as in <A HREF="http://eprint.uq.edu.au/">ePrintsUQ</A>. To see all your statistics, search on your surname. Download counts for abstract views and file downloads are stored with each item. An upgrade of the statistics functionality in <A HREF="http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/">UQ eSpace</A> is planned for this year. <P>

 <B><A NAME="meas">What is measured?</A></B><BR>
Currently, downloads by individuals are the only counts we include in our statistics. Our statistics service specifically excludes downloads of metadata or files by search engine crawlers or other automated harvesters. This may result in smaller download numbers than in <A HREF="http://eprint.uq.edu.au/">ePrintsUQ</A>, but the <A HREF="http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/">UQ eSpace</A> counts probably represent a truer picture of actual document usage.

<P>
<HR NOSHADE>
<P>

<B><A NAME="whydep">Why should I deposit my research in UQ eSpace?</A></B> <BR>
Archiving work maximises the visibility and accessibility of one's research, and hence its usage and impact. Research freely available online is much more highly cited than work available only in print. (Lawrence, S. (2001) <A HREF="http://www.nature.com/nature/debates/e-access/Articles/lawrence.html"><I>Free online availability substantially increases a paper's impact</I></A>: Nature Web debates).<P>

Even if your research papers have been published in online journals, many academics and researchers, particularly those from poorer institutions or from developing countries, will still not be able to read them, because of access barriers such as passwords, subscription costs, licensing agreements or IP restrictions. This means your research may not reach many people who might otherwise be interested in using it and citing it. Its presence in an open repository archive such as UQ eSpace guarantees your work can reach a truly global audience on a scale impossible to achieve on paper. This maximises the impact of your work within the global academic community.
<P>
Depositing research datasets guarantees their safekeeping. It also makes it possible for other researchers to use your data in their own research, which helps speed up world scholarship. Data curation is increasingly seen as important by government and funding bodies such as the ARC. Using UQ eSpace to store your research data can help you comply with these new requirements of grant-making bodies.
<P>


<B><A NAME="archelse">Why do I need to deposit work here when my papers are already archived by the online journals in which they are published?</A></B><BR>
While many journal publishers are creating online archives of published articles, there is no guarantee that this material will be available and accessible long term. Also, if library subscriptions to journals lapse, there is no guarantee that UQ researchers will still have access to the materials covered by earlier subscriptions. Also, as those sites reorganise, URLs may change. UQ eSpace can guarantee you long-term access and secure storage with permanent URLs for any work deposited.
<p>

 <B><A NAME="eprintsuq">What has happened to <A HREF="http://eprint.uq.edu.au/">ePrintsUQ</A>?</A></B><BR>
<A HREF="http://eprint.uq.edu.au/">ePrintsUQ</A> is still operating as a storehouse for UQ research publications. No further content can be added to it. All the content has been successfully migrated to <A HREF="http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/">UQ eSpace</A>, so some materials are currently housed in both repositories. Since people may have recorded the URLs of ePrintsUQ deposits, we are keeping ePrintsUQ going until we can redirect all existing ePrintsUQ URLs to their new <A HREF="http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/">UQ eSpace</A> addresses. In time, ePrintsUQ will be decommissioned, but that will not occur for some time.<P>

 <B><A NAME="move">Why did you move from <A HREF="http://eprint.uq.edu.au/">ePrintsUQ</A> to <A HREF="http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/">UQ eSpace</A>?</A></B><BR>
In <A HREF="http://eprint.uq.edu.au/">ePrintsUQ</A>, we stored deposits of publications in a single collection. However, publications form only a minor part of the research output of this university. We needed a system that could accommodate more than just publications - one that could house datasets, image libraries, multimedia and other research materials, all with different metadata and different subject classification needs, and all housed in different communities and collections with very different security rules. <A HREF="http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/">UQ eSpace</A>  gives us that flexibility. In addition, <A HREF="http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/">UQ eSpace</A> provides us with preservation metadata to enable us to keep your data sustainably over the long term. We are also using UQ eSpace for research assessment trials and will use it to deliver some of the functionality required for the RQF.<P>

<B><A NAME="secure">How secure is my work?</A></B><BR>
The repository is backed up every day on to the Library's Storage Area Network. <P>

<B><A NAME="keep">How long will my work be kept?</A></B><BR>
<A HREF="http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/">UQ eSpace</A> cannot guarantee your work will be saved 'forever'. However we do guarantee that we will keep it for a long time. We currently apply preservation metadata to all deposited work - this is an XML stream attached to the object that provides the necessary information about the object to preserve it and keep it usable. We may migrate some deposited work to new formats as formats change or become obsolete. <P>

<B><A NAME="forchange">What is UQ eSpace planning to do about format changes?</A></B><BR>
We are incorporating the <A HREF="http://www.apsr.edu.au/publications/aons_report.pdf">Automated Obsolescence Notification System </A> (AONS),  which analyses digital repositories to determine whether any digital objects contained therein may be in danger of becoming
obsolete. It uses preservation information about file formats and the software which supports these formats to determine if the formats used by digital objects are in danger. The information used is gleaned from various registries (<A HREF="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pronom/">PRONOM</A> and <A HREF="http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/">LCSDF</A>) and stored in a <A HREF="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</A> database. AONS then periodically checks the repository contents for formats at risk. When the repository is found to contain such formats, a notification report is sent to the repository manager. A notification report may trigger a migration event for a group of objects stored in the at-risk format.

<B><A NAME="copyright">What about copyright?</A></B><BR>
The author holds the copyright for any pre-refereed pre-print, so that version can be self-archived without seeking anyone's permission. For refereed post-prints, it all depends on what rights you transferred to the journal publisher when you signed a contract with them. Check your contract. Some publishers do not ask for exclusivity; some seek to use the material only under license. Should copyright have been fully transferred to the publisher, authors can use UQ eSpace's sample permissions letter to ask for permission to deposit a copy in the archive. (Many publishers also have an email permissions form on their Web Site, which is quicker.) For future contracts, authors can try to modify the copyright transfer agreement to allow such archiving by including a clause such as <I>'I retain the right to distribute my paper for free for scholarly/scientific purposes, in particular, the right to self-archive it publicly online in a Web-based institutional repository such as UQ eSpace (http://espace.uq.edu.au/).'</I> Failing that, authors can deposit a corrigenda file (a file explaining changes between pre- and post-print versions) to accompany an already archived pre-print. The <A HREF="#help">UQ eSpace Co-ordinator</A> can advise you about copyright issues. More information on publisher policies about copyright and permissions can be found at <A HREF="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo.php">SHERPA</A>, though these should not be taken as final. Journal publisher policies in this area are constantly evolving.

<P>
<B><A NAME="rqfplans">What is happening with the RQF?</A></B><BR>
UQ eSpace has been used for RQF-like trials since 2006. The data already entered for these trials can probably be reused for RQF 2008, if required. UQ eSpace staff are working with staff from the Office of the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research) and the Office of Research and Postgraduate Studies to plan for the electronic delivery of UQ research data for the RQF. This involves looking at issues such as copyright. Please consult the <A HREF="#help">UQ eSpace Co-ordinator</A> if you want more information.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="comply">Is UQ eSpace OAI-compliant?</A></B><BR>
Yes. The <A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/">Open Archives Initiative</A> (OAI) develops and promotes interoperability standards to facilitate the efficient dissemination of content. The OAI championed scholarly digital repositories as a means of increasing the ongoing availability of scholarly communications. Since UQ eSpace complies with these standards, information about the works deposited in our archive is open access and can be harvested, for example, by Internet search engines or by cross-archive search tools such as <A HREF="http://oaister.umdl.umich.edu/o/oaister/">OAIster</A>. Open access greatly increases the visibility of your research.
<P>

<B><A NAME="baseurl">What is UQ eSpace's base URL for OAI harvesters?</A></B><BR>
