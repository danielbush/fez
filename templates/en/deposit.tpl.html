<p>To deposit records in {$smarty.const.APP_NAME}, you must be logged in.</p>

<p>Please use the <b>Login</b> link if you are currently a {$smarty.const.APP_SHORT_ORG_NAME} staff member or student.</p>

<p>External registered users should use the <b>Non-{$smarty.const.APP_SHORT_ORG_NAME} login</b> on the <b>Login</b> page. If you are a former staff member or postgraduate student, and you would like to register as a user, please contact us about obtaining a log in.</p>

<p>Deposits of items should begin in the collection to which the item will belong, e.g. <b>Advanced Water Management Centre Publications</b>; <b>School of Engineering Publications</b>; <b>Discussion Papers (School of Economics)</b>.</p>

<p>Find your collection by using the <b>Browse</b> tab. A list of communities will appear, e.g. <b>Faculty of Health Sciences</b>. Your collection should be found under the appropriate Faculty. Navigate to your collection. This will open the web page for that collection.</p>

<p>Select your desired document type, e.g. Journal article, from the drop-down list, then click <b>Create</b>. If you do not see the document type you need, please contact us for help.</p>

<p>Fill in the details of the form, link to or upload a file, then click <b>Submit for Approval</b>. That completes the deposit process.</p>
