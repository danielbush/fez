#Fez

Fez is a PHP / MySQL front end to the Fedora repository software. It is developed by the University of Queensland Library as an open source project.

We will add more to github markdown wiki documentation soon, but for now most of our information is still located at http://fez.library.uq.edu.au/ and http://fez.library.uq.edu.au/wiki/Main_Page
