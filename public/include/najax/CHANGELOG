0.4.1.0 (minor)                         09/20/2005
-----------------------------------------------------

 fixed: small bug-fixes in the chatAdvanced example -
        the error dialog was removed;

 added: najax.html.importForm (imports an associative
        array to the corresponding form elements)
        and najax.html.exportForm (exports form values
        to an associative array);

 added: support for asynchronous calls canceling;


0.4.0.0 (major)                         09/18/2005
-----------------------------------------------------

 fixed: serious bug in NACLES; some events were
        posted more than once in case of a slow
        connection to the server;

 added: support for Server Extensions and
        Client observers; you can extend NAJAX
        as much as you want;

 added: NAJAX_HTML extension - tutorial coming
        soon;

 added: new example scripts - Exam and HTML;
        new tutorial - NAJAX Page Skeleton;

 added: NACLES providers now support the 'port'
        parameter; big thanks to
        JurriÃ«n Stutterheim;

 fixed: the new client error handling introduced in
        0.3.0.0 RC1 - instead of 'onMethodName' it
        was calling 'OnmethodName';


0.3.0.0 RC1 (major)                     08/29/2005
-----------------------------------------------------

 added: NAJAX Client Event System (NACLES);

 added: MySQL provider for NACLES; you can configure
        it from najax.config.php;

 added: NAJAX_Server::allowClasses(...);

 added: NAJAX_Server::denyClasses(...);

 added: najax.asyncCall in najax.js (najax_optimized.js);
        pass it as last argument to function calls and
        they'll be called asynchronously:

        client.Test();					//  Synchronous
        client.Test(najax.asyncCall);	//	Asynchronous

 added: better client error handling; you can create
        custom method error handlers, like this:

        client.onTestError = function(error) {
        	alert(error.message);
        	return true;
        };

        client.setTimeout(2500);
        client.Test(najax.asyncCall);

        Note that you must return true to suppress
        exception bubbling;

 fixed: when a class performs a callback,
        NAJAX_Server::runServer(...) validates the
        callback - checks if the class is allowed
        and if the called method is public;


0.2.1.2 (minor)                         08/08/2005
-----------------------------------------------------

 comment: JavaScript functions have been renamed to
          najax.functionName(...);

 fixed:   NAJAX_Server::initializeCallback(...) now
          checks if the called method is public;

 comment: NAJAX_SERIALIZER_SKIP_STRING and
          NAJAX_CLIENT_METADATA_METHOD_NAME have
          been moved to najax.config.php;

 comment: publicMethods(...), privateMethods(...),
          publicVariables(...), privateVariables(...)
          and mapMethods(...) have been moved from
          NAJAX_Utilities to NAJAX_Client;


0.2.1.0	(minor)                         08/04/2005

 added:   NAJAX_Server support for server side events;

 fixed:   najax_optimized.js has been compressed using
          http://dean.edwards.name/packer/;

 fixed:   Package documentation has been updated;

 comment: NAJAX_Server::initialize(...) has been renamed
          to NAJAX_Server::runServer(...);


0.2.0.2 (minor)                         08/01/2005
-----------------------------------------------------

 added: NAJAX_Server::mapClass(...); use this method
        to map class names to the files where they are
        defined; only the class that is the source of the
        callback will be loaded;

 added: The Chat example now supports emoticons and
        hyperlinks;

 fixed: __clone is now using najaxClone(...) to merge
        two objects; when a method deletes a member
        it's value will be null; when a method adds
        a new member it will be available immediately
        after the call ends;


0.2.0.1 (minor)                         07/31/2005
-----------------------------------------------------

 fixed: The Chat example; the class name is 'Explorer',
        but the script was using 'explorer';
