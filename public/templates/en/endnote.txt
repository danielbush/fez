%T Creating the Essential Links for Educating the Evidence-Based Medical Practitioner of the 21st Century
%X A new postgraduate Medical (MBBS) program at the University of Queensland has been the catalyst for the development of a range of University of Queensland (UQ) Cybrary initiatives,
  in areas of information resources, services and support. Over the past seven years the UQ Cybrary has successfully integrated library services into the problem-based learning and the e-learning
  environment of the MBBS Program. Information and communications technology developments have been harnessed by the Cybrary to support the needs of the Program which are dispersed throughout the
  vast state of Queensland. In particular, there has been a focus on using information and communications technology (ICT) to provide efficient and equitable access for all those involved with UQ
  city and rural health education. The Cybrary has risen to the challenge of providing information services and resources to support evidence-based practice (EBP) and lifelong learning, ultimately
  contributing towards achieving an outstanding medical workforce for the 21st Century. This paper will outline how the UQ Cybrary has addressed these issues, particularly in the areas of integration
  of online materials in the e-learning environment, the development and delivery of tailored information literacy programs and the use of ICT to support access to information and
  services.

%T Rural But Not Remote! Access in Outback Australia. Report on the Implementation of Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) for Medical Students, Clinical Teaching Staff and Health Librarians  at the Rural Clinical Division, School of Medicine, University of Queensland, Australia
%X Funding to provide 95 Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) to medical students, located at the Rural Clinical Divisions (RCD) in outback Australian Queensland regions, was obtained in
  2003 from the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing. The PDA Project commenced in October 2003 and will continue until the end of 2004. The objectives of the Project were to provide
  access to authoritative, evidence-based information to rural medical students at their point of need and to address equity issues for students placed in remote or isolated areas with limited access
  to information and technology infrastructure. The project will be used to identify how such technology can help to educate and prepare students for practicing medicine in the 21st Century and as a
  means to identify appropriate resources, training and support required to utilise PDAs. The Herston Medical Library, University of Queensland, provided a senior Liaison Librarian as the Rural Pack
  Project Coordinator, along with two Liaison Librarians, who are based at the rural sites in the Central Region and the South West Region of Queensland, each working at the main hospital within each
  region. The Coordinator of the Project has led a team of clinicians, librarians, information technology representatives, a medical education officer and medical students to evaluate the technology.
  Included on each PDA distributed to PDA Project participants are e-resources, including a major drug index, medical textbooks, a medical dictionary and a medical calculator. The Microsoft Office
  Suite of software, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook are also included on each PDA. A report on the implementation of the Project, study design and outcomes reported during 2004 is
  provided. Various challenges, such as licensing complexities, that were encountered with the introduction of this innovative service are outlined, as well as future plans.
