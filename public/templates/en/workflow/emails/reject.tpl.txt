Dear {$name},

This is an automated message from the {$application_name} service.

A record you have deposited '{$title}' cannot be accepted into {$application_name} in its current form.

There is insufficient data for us to identify the publication uniquely. We require a complete citation (e.g. author(s), title, journal or conference title, volume, issue, and page numbers, and a DOI, if available.)

Accordingly, the record has been returned to your My Work In Progress tab within My eSpace. 

Please add more data to the record and then submit the record for approval again.

Please contact {$application_name} staff if you require assistance to complete the record.

Regards,

Manager - {$application_name}
