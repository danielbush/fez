Dear Unit Publication Officer/s,


We are currently processing the following journal article record in UQ eSpace: {$pidUrl} 
This publication includes author(s)/co-author(s) affiliated with your unit.

In order for the record to be considered for HERDC we require some additional evidence.
Please provide a copy of pages from the journal as follows:
   - Title page
   - Table of contents
   - Full copy of paper and bylines
   - Page that includes a statement of peer-review

If there is no statement of peer-review in the journal, please provide a copy of the article peer-review assessment (many academics keep these).


Please note that if any of the authors being claimed do not have a published affiliation with UQ anywhere in the article or journal, 
we also require an author-signed author affiliation form (or claim email detailing the publication and eSpace PID number from the author), plus supporting staff database evidence.  
This can be provided along with the publication evidence listed above. 

Options for sending the evidence to UQ eSpace:
   - Scan and attach to return email
   - Copy and post/deliver to UQ eSpace, Level 6, Duhig Building, St. Lucia campus, St. Lucia  Qld  4072


If you are unable to provide any of the above, please let us know by return email as soon as possible.


Kind regards,
