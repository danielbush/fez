        <p>Dear Unit Publication Officer/s,</p>

        <p>We are currently processing the following journal article record in 
            UQ eSpace: {$pidUrl} 
            This publication includes author(s)/co-author(s) affiliated with your unit.
        </p>

        <p>
            In order for the record to be considered for HERDC we require some additional evidence.
        </p>    

        <p>
            Please provide a copy of pages from the journal as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>Title page</li>
                <li>Table of contents</li>
                <li>Full copy of paper and bylines</li>
                <li>Page that includes a statement of peer-review</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p> 
            If there is no statement of peer-review in the journal, 
            please provide a copy of the article peer-review assessment (many academics keep these).
        </p>

        
        <p>
            <b>Please note</b> that if any of the authors being claimed do not have a published affiliation with UQ anywhere in the article or journal, 
            we also require an author-signed author affiliation form (or claim email detailing the publication and eSpace PID number from the author), 
            plus supporting staff database evidence.  
            This can be provided along with the publication evidence listed above. 
        </p>

        
        <p>
