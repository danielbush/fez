Dear Unit Publication Officer/s,


We are currently processing the following conference paper record in UQ eSpace: {$pidUrl}

   - Full copy of paper, including bylines 
   - If no byline, page with a statement of author affiliation 
   - Page that includes a statement of peer-review

If there is no statement of peer-review in the proceedings, please provide a copy of the paper peer-review assessment (many academics keep these).


Please note that if any of the authors being claimed do not have a published affiliation with UQ anywhere on the paper or in the proceedings, 
we also require an author-signed author affiliation form (or claim email detailing the publication and eSpace PID number from the author), plus supporting staff database evidence.  
This can be provided along with the publication evidence listed above.
