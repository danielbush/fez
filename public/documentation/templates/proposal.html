 <h3>Background and Motivation</h3>

 <dl> 

  <dt>What is the setting and history behind this project?</dt> 
 
  <dd>The University of Queenland Library has various a number of existing digital repositories in various states which contain numerous collections of data. Many of these systems overlap in functionality but have some specific nuance according to the type of data stored within. It has long be wished for a central digital repository to replace the multiple number of systems that can offer more of the functionality and lessen the amount of administration and maintenance currently carried out.</dd>


  <dt>What is the problem to be addressed?</dt> 
  
  <dd>The need for a central digital repository to contain collections of records of very different material in a sustainable way. </dd>


  <dt>What are some current approaches to this problem?</dt> 
 
  <dd>There are many open source digital repository software packages
available yet these are the main competitors to Fedora:
    <ul>
   <li><a href="http://www.dspace.org">DSpace</a></li>
   <li><a href="http://www.eprints.org">ePrints</a> (Aimed more towards scholarly publishing)</li>
   </ul>
  </dd>

  <dd>There are also some existing FEDORA web interfaces in various stages of functionality and availability:</dd>
  <dd>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://elated.sourceforge.net/">Elated</a> (JSP)</li>
        <li>Cornell CMS (not ready for general distribution at this time) (PHP)</li>
        <li>New Jersey Workflow Managment System (no announced plans to make generally available - see <a href="http://www.scc.rutgers.edu/fedora_conf_2005/program.html">Fedora Conference 2005</a> abstracts)</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
 </dl>
 <dl>
   <dt>Why is this problem worth solving or worth solving better?</dt>
   <dd>None of the existing solutions offer the full required functionality or flexibility Fez will provide. </dd>
   <dt>How will this product be better than previous approaches?</dt>
   <dd>We add innovative new features.  Our system will have similar functionality, but
      it will have much better configurabillity, maintainability, scalability, and
      security.</dd>
   <dt>Where is there more information on this problem?</dt>
   <dd>The following pages provide additional background and
      motivation:
