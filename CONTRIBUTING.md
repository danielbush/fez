For now we will accept pull requests and for trusted members we can add you to a push group.

We will add instructions here shortly for recommendations for phpcs and commit message integration with github issues and our pivotal tracker instance.

Until then you can join us in the Fez campfire here and talk to us :) https://fez.campfirenow.com/b99aa
