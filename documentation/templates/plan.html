 <h3>Summary of Methodology</h3>
 <dl>
  <dt>What general development approach will be used?</dt>
  </dl>
 <ul>
   <li>Development using prototype site with small group of user / testers. Fez 0.1.0 will be used by a select group of Communities and Collections. The UQ Library will be the initial primary user for Collections such as meeting notes, Fryer Findaids, image collections.</li>
   <li>Subversion will be used to track changes to project source code and database schemas</li>
   <li>Programmers will each work using a personal test site, checking changes into subversion regularly </li>
   <li>The prototype site will be updated from subversion to pickup changes from developers, the user / testers are asked to test any new features</li>
   <li>The featureset is worked through according to a project plan in various development phases. At the end of each phase, the project is reviewed for changes to the features and the project plan is updated to reflect any changed goals</li>
 </ul>
 <dl>
   <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
   <dd>For more information see the <a
  href="sdm.html">Software Development Methodology</a>.</dd>
   <dt>How will the project team be organized?</dt>
   <dd>The development team will consist of Christiaan Kortekaas and Matthew Smith. </dd>
   <dd>The change control board will consist of Belinda Weaver, Chris Taylor, Eric Hornsby and Andrew Bennett. </dd>
   <dt>What development and collaboration tools will be use?</dt>
   <dd>We plan to use the following tools
     extensively through out the project:
       <ul>
        <li>Project website (<a href="http://www.library.uq.edu.au/escholarship">http://www.library.uq.edu.au/escholarship</a>) </li>
        <li><a href="http://helpdesk.library.uq.edu.au/">Eventum</a> - Issue tracking system</li>
        <li><a href="http://sandpit.library.uq.edu.au/WebSVN">Subversion</a> - Version control system</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
   <dt>How will changes be controlled?</dt>
   <dd>
       <ul>
        <li>Requests for requirements changes will be tracked in the issue
        tracker</li>
        
    <li>The change control board (<a class="def"
    href="glossary-std.html#ccb">CCB</a>) will review requested
        changes and authorize work on them as appropriate</li>
        
    <li>After the <a class="def"
    href="glossary-std.html#featurecomplete">feature complete</a>
        milestone, no new features will be added to this release.</li>
        
    <li>After the <a class="def"
    href="glossary-std.html#codecomplete">code complete</a> milestone,
        no entirely new product source code will be added to this
        release.</li>
        
    <li>All source code commit log messages must refer to a specific
        issue ID, after the feature complete milestone.</li>
        
   </ul>
    </dd>
   <dt>How will this plan be updated?</dt>
   <dd>This project plan will be updated as needed throughout the
      project.  It will be placed under version control and instructions
      for accessing it will be on the <a href="index.html">project
      website</a>.  Any change to the plan will cause manual notification to be sent to a project mailing list.</dd>

 <h3>Risk Management</h3>
 <p>The main risk is that the project will lose funding and be cancelled. Reasons for this would be if it is not seen to be providing benefit to the library. To try and avoid this, the initial focus for the project is to get the most basic usable functionality working and deployed for use in the library. High visibility of progress is needed so that the project is perceived to be progressing and acheiving it's goals. </p>
 <p>It's a risk that the project will not be able to handle the data we need reliably and in a timely fashion. We are relying on the Fedora project to be a good quality product. The Fedora project seems to be in active development so we are confident that it will meet the needs of the digital repository.</p>
 <p>To avoid loss of data from software corruption, hardware failure or dissaster, the repository will be backed up.</p>

 <h3>Project Planning Dependencies</h3>

 <dl>

  <dt>Does this project conflict or compete for resources with any
  other project?</dt>

  <dd >Yes, and we have determined how many hours each
  person can actually dedicate to this project. A programmer will be working on the project virtually full time, while another programmer will work at about 50% of their time (MS). </dd>


  <dt>Are the same human or machine resources allocated to maintenance
  of past versions and/or planning of future versions during this
  release time period?</dt>

  <dd >Yes, we predict that team members
  will spend an average of 5% of their time maintaining
  previous releases and planning future releases during this release
  time frame.  Some weeks may be higher if an urgent patch to a
  previous release is needed.</dd>



  <dt>Does this project depend on the success of any other
  project?</dt>

  <dd >Yes, the Fedora Project (external) is core to the success and sustainability of this project, although the Fedora source is available so if that project ended it could be continued internally or by the open source community. </dd>

  
  <dt>Does any other project depend on this project?</dt>

  <dd >Yes, the UQ Library Archives system, Australian Digital Theses system, Digilib, WebLaw, ePrints, Fryer Archives (EAD), Vetscans Archival and UQ Library Meeting Notes systems will be transferred  into Fez under various levels of security.</dd>

  <dt>Are there any other important dependencies that will affect this project?</dt>

  <dd >No, everything is covered above.</dd>
