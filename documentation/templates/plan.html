 <h3>Summary of Methodology</h3>
 <dl>
  <dt>What general development approach will be used?</dt>
  </dl>
 <ul>
   <li>Development using prototype site with small group of user / testers. Fez 1.2.0 Beta will be used by a select group of Communities and Collections. The UQ Library will be the initial primary user for Collections such as meeting notes, Fryer Findaids, image collections.</li>
   <li>Subversion will be used to track changes to project source code and database schemas</li>
   <li>Programmers will each work using a personal test site, checking changes into subversion regularly </li>
   <li>The prototype site will be updated from subversion to pickup changes from developers, the user / testers are asked to test any new features</li>
   <li>The featureset is worked through according to a project plan in various development phases. At the end of each phase, the project is reviewed for changes to the features and the project plan is updated to reflect any changed goals</li>
 </ul>
 <dl>
   <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
   <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
   <dt>How will the project team be organized?</dt>
   <dd>The development team will consist of Christiaan Kortekaas and Matthew Smith. </dd>
   <dd>The change control board will consist of Belinda Weaver, Chris Taylor, Eric Hornsby and Andrew Bennett. </dd>
   <dt>What development and collaboration tools will be use?</dt>
   <dd>We plan to use the following tools
     extensively through out the project:
       <ul>
        <li>Project website (<a href="http://www.library.uq.edu.au/escholarship">http://www.library.uq.edu.au/escholarship</a>) </li>
        <li><a href="http://helpdesk.library.uq.edu.au/">Eventum</a> - Issue tracking system</li>
        <li><a href="http://sandpit.library.uq.edu.au/WebSVN">Subversion</a> - Version control system</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
   <dt>How will changes be controlled?</dt>
   <dd>
       <ul>
        <li>Requests for requirements changes will be tracked in the issue
        tracker</li>
        
    <li>The change control board (<a class="def"
    href="glossary-std.html#ccb">CCB</a>) will review requested
        changes and authorize work on them as appropriate</li>
        
    <li>After the <a class="def"
    href="glossary-std.html#featurecomplete">feature complete</a>
        milestone, no new features will be added to this release.</li>
        
    <li>After the <a class="def"
    href="glossary-std.html#codecomplete">code complete</a> milestone,
        no entirely new product source code will be added to this
        release.</li>
        
    <li>All source code commit log messages must refer to a specific
        issue ID, after the feature complete milestone.</li>

 <h3>Project Planning Dependencies</h3>

 <dl>

  <dt>Does this project conflict or compete for resources with any
  other project?</dt>

  <dd >Yes, and we have determined how many hours each
  person can actually dedicate to this project. A programmer will be working on the project virtually full time, while another programmer will work at about 50% of their time (MS). </dd>


  <dt>Are the same human or machine resources allocated to maintenance
  of past versions and/or planning of future versions during this
  release time period?</dt>

  <dd >Yes, we predict that team members
  will spend an average of 5% of their time maintaining
  previous releases and planning future releases during this release
  time frame.  Some weeks may be higher if an urgent patch to a
  previous release is needed.</dd>



  <dt>Does this project depend on the success of any other
  project?</dt>

  <dd >Yes, the Fedora Project (external) is core to the success and sustainability of this project, although the Fedora source is available so if that project ended it could be continued internally or by the open source community. </dd>

  
  <dt>Does any other project depend on this project?</dt>

  <dd >Yes, the UQ Library Archives system, Australian Digital Theses system, Digilib, WebLaw, ePrints, Fryer Archives (EAD), Vetscans Archival and UQ Library Meeting Notes systems will be transferred  into Fez under various levels of security.</dd>
