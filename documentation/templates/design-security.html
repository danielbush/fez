 <h3>Overview</h3>


 <dl>

  <dt>What are the most important facts that a developer should know
  about the security of this system?</dt>

  <dd>Fez uses a highly configurable and granular method for authentication and authorisation named Fez Access Control Markup Language (FezACML). It is saved as a datastream in objects in Fez. If an Fez Record object does not have an FezACML datastream the web application will attempt to find any parent Collection  object's FezACML datastreams and use the access rules in those datastreams. If the Fez Record has more than only parent Collection then the access logic will try and authenticate and authorise the user against each parent FezACML (using boolean OR logic, not AND logic).</dd>

 <h3>Security Mechanisms</h3>

 <dl>
  <dt>What physical security mechanisms will be used?</dt>

  <dd class="sample1">
   <ul>
    <li>Servers will be kept in a locked room with door code known
    only to administrators.</li>

    <li>Servers will be kept in a locked equipment rack.</li>

    <li>Server case itself has a security cable that prevents the case
    from being opened (so the hard-disk with sensitive data cannot be
    removed).</li>

    <li>Backup tapes are stored in a locked cabinet in a locked room.</li>
   </ul>
  </dd>


  <dt>What network security mechanisms will be used?</dt>

  <dd class="sample1"><ul><li>Firewall software limits access to specific network ports
    (e.g., port 80 for web server access).</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>


  <dt>What operating system security will be used?</dt>

  <dd class="sample1">
   <ul>
    <li>Operating system user accounts will never be created on the
    servers, other than those needed by the application itself.</li>

    <li>Different components in the application execute as different
    operating system users, have only the least possible
    privileges, and may only access the particular files needed by that
    component.</li>

    <li>Operating system permissions on files and directories are set
    to prevent undesired access or modification.</li>

    <li>Intrusion detection software will be used on the server to
    detect any modifications made by hackers.</li>

    <li>Administrators will monitor security mailing lists for
    announcements of security holes in any components that we use and
    security patches and upgrades will be applied quickly.</li>

    <li>Data on disks and backup tapes is stored using an encrypted
    file system so that the data is protected if the media itself is
    stolen or somehow accessed.</li>
   </ul>
  </dd>

  
  <dt>What application security mechanisms will be used?</dt>

  <dd class="sample1">
   <ul>
    <li>Access and Authorisaion to objects in Fez is controlled by Fez Access Control Markup Language, saved as a datastream in Fez objects. It is highly configurable and can be set on the community, collection or as granular as the per object level. </li>

    <li>Sessions are tied to a particular client IP-address so that
      stolen cookies cannot be used.</li>
    <li>Sessions time out so that unattended terminals cannot be
    abused.</li>

    <li>The HTML generation layer will be responsible for preventing
    cross-site-scripting (XSS) attacks.</li>

    </ul>

 <h3>Security Checklist</h3>

 <dl>
  <dt>Protection of data: To what extent has this been achieved?</dt>

  <dd>All the servers in the Fez environment are backed up to tape nightly. </dd>


  <dt>Prevention of intrusion: To what extent has this been achieved?</dt>

  <dd>The servers Fez runs on are firewalled to allow administrator access only from certain IPs and requires an SSH Key and password. </dd>


  <dt>Prevention of abuse: To what extent has this been achieved?</dt>

  <dd>Web application security prevents access to modification of objects to select access groups based on FezACML. </dd>


  <dt>Accountability/auditing: To what extent has this been achieved?</dt>

  <dd>Access and error logging on the Apache webserver is enabled so track suspicious network traffic. The Fez inbuilt Fedora version control system will track changes to objects.</dd>


  <dt>Have these security mechanisms been communicated to the
  development team and other stakeholders?</dt>

  <dd class="sample1">Yes, everyone understands.  Feedback is
  welcome.</dd>

  <dd class="sample1">&nbsp;</dd>
