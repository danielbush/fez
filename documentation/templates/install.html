  <dt>What other software must be installed first?</dt>

  <dd class="sample1">Fez has been tested successfully on Windows, Linux and Apple OS/X operating systems. Before you can install this product, you must install the
  following packages. This can all be installed on the one server, or separate servers for mysql, apache, fedora if you wish.
    <ul><li><a href="http://www.fedora.info/">Fedora 2.1 Digital Repository</a>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Note</strong>: You can also use Fedora 2.0 instead by  modfying the Fez generated <strong>config.inc.php</strong> by commenting out the 2.1 API-M and API-A soap locations and uncommenting the 2.0 locations (2 lines each). This is due to the fact the API soap locations were changed from 2.0 to 2.1.</li>
        <li><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Make sure when you setup Fedora that you set the fedora.fcfg <strong>resourceIndex level to at least &quot;1&quot;</strong> as this is required to to reindex Fedora objects into Fez. Also make sure that whatever<strong> PID prefix namespace you choose is also in the &quot;retainPIDS&quot; set of namespaces</strong>. Eg if your PID namespace is &quot;UQ&quot; make sure &quot;UQ&quot; is in the list of retainPIDS in fedora.fcfg. If this is not set then Fez will not be able to create objects in Fedora. <br /> 
            <br />
        </li>
        <li><strong>Recommendations:
          </strong>          
            <ul>
                <li>We have had performance issues while using the Fedora 2.1b XACML engine, so suggest setting it to &quot;permit-all-requests&quot; (turns it off) until this is fixed with the final 2.1 release. With this setting Fedora still requires authentication for the API-M, but we strongly suggest you firewall the Fedora server to allow access to port 8080 (Fedora tomcat port) to only the Fez webserver. If you do not experience noticable performance degradation with XACML set to &quot;enforce-policies&quot; (turned on) we still reccommend firewalling the Fedora server for added security. </li>
                <li>Since Fez has its own &quot;index&quot; for searching through Fedora we suggest turning off the Fedora Kowari index as this will improve Fedora performance. Fez only requires the Kowari resource index to be turned on if you wish to reindex Fedora objects back into Fez.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>	
    <li><a href="http://java.sun.com/">Java SDK</a>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Notes:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>The Java SDK 1.4.2 is required by Fedora and JHOVE (for the JRE). Setup the JAVA_HOME, FEDORA_HOME and other environment variables as per the Fedora <a href="http://www.fedora.info/download/2.1b/userdocs/distribution/installation.html">installation instructions</a>. According to the Fedora mailing list there are problems with using Java version 1.5, so it is preferable to use version 1.4.2. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/">Apache Web Server</a>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Notes:</strong>          
              <ul>
                <li>We have only tested using Apache 1.3.x, however there should be no reason Fez won't run on Apache 2.x. Fez should also be able to run on any webserver that will support PHP5 (eg Microsoft IIS etc) but we have not tested this yet. </li>
                <li>We recommend setting apache to recognise &quot;index.php&quot; as a &quot;Directory Index&quot; so that the Fez index file is loaded immediately eg: 
                  <ul>
                    <li>&lt;IfModule mod_dir.c&gt;<br />
    DirectoryIndex <strong>index.php</strong> index.html<br />
&lt;/IfModule&gt;</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://dev.mysql.com/">MySQL 4.1+ database</a>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Note:</strong> We think we have sorted out the bugs with Fez and MySQL 5, so Fez 1.2 should work with it now. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP 5</a>
(Fez uses the new PHP5 DOM Document XML functions to handle XML objects so PHP4.x will not run Fez).
  <ul>
        <li>These <strong>PHP extensions</strong> must be enabled and the libraries installed where neccessary (the links take you to the php manual with installation instructions for each extension):
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.php.net/tidy">Tidy</a> - for linux make sure libtidy, libtidy-dev and tidy packages are installed before compiling php </li>
            <li><a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.ldap.php">LDAP</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.php.net/GD">GD</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.php.net/mysql">MySQL</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.php.net/curl">CURL</a></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>WARNING!</strong>: When compiling PHP we have noticed that DOMXPATH does not work with some versions of LIBXML2. We have successfully tested using DOMXPATH with LIBXML2 version 2.6.16 (on Linux Centos) and 2.6.23 (latest version of LIBXML on Redhat Fedora 4), but it causes a failure in PHP with version 2.6.19 (on Linux Red Hat Fedora 4). We have only tested these three versions so others may work or fail as well. </li>
        <li><strong>PHP.ini</strong> configuration requirements:
            <ul>
                <li>allow_call_time_pass_reference = On (Fez may not need this in future releases, especially since it will probabaly be deprecated in PHP6)</li>
              </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>PHP.ini</strong> configuration recommendations:
          <ul>
            <li>upload_max_filesize = 10M (default is 2M, but if you want to upload more than 2 megabyte files then change this so suit).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://www.imagemagick.com/">Image Magick</a> (for thumbnail resizing and image previewing)
      <ul>
        <li>For Windows servers you will need to install the dll version available on the Image Magick website 
          <ul>
            <li>Make sure you add the Image Magick directory containing the 'identify' and 'convert' executables in the windows environment path </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>For Linux you can download the source and compile it, or use one of the binaries for your Linux distro
          <ul>
            <li>For Linux Fez expects the IM commands 'identify' and 'convert' to be in certain locations set in the Fez config.inc.php. Make sure they are the correct paths and change the config.inc.php settings if necessary.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a> (for workflow diagrams)
      <ul>
        <li>For Windows servers you will need to install the windows install executable version. The windows installer adds the executable directory to the PATH environment variable automatically.</li>
        <li>For Linux you can install the RPM package on the Graphviz site or install it from source. Make sure the 'dot' executable path is in the PATH environment variable. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://hul.harvard.edu/jhove/">JHOVE</a> (for preservation metadata extraction) 
      <ul>
        <li>Be sure to edit the jhove.bat (windows) or jhove command (linux) and set the JHOVE_HOME and other variables inside them as per the JHOVE <a href="http://hul.harvard.edu/jhove/distribution.html">installation instructions</a>. This can also be done with the configure.pl perl script in the JHOVE distribution. 
          <ul>
            <li>Fez expects JHOVE to be in /usr/local/jhove for linux or c:/jhove for windows. If you install jhove to different directories to this then update the Fez config.inc.php with the correct locations. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>

  <dt>How do I install Fez?</dt>

  <dd class="sample1">
   Please follow these steps:
   <ol>
    <li>Download the latest Fez release from SourceForge <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fez">here</a> </li>
    <li>Uncompress to a folder in your <strong>htdocs</strong> Apache directory
      <ul>
      <li>Note: You may wish to set the Fez directory up as &quot;Virtual Host&quot; or as the &quot;Document Root&quot; in your Apache httpd.conf file. </li>
      <li>If you are using Linux then make sure the user that runs the apache service has rights to be able to write files to the fez folders. Apache/PHP will need to write the config.inc.php file, create the templates_c directory, the include/private_key.php file and the error_log.log file. </li>
      </ul>
      </li>
    <li>Open your web browser and load the &quot;http://<em>yourserver.com</em>/fez/setup/&quot;. This will load the config setup interface. 
      <ul>
        <li>Note: If any of the <strong>PHP requirements</strong> are missing the setup script will ask you to install them first, rather than show the config form. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Fill in the setup config details and click &quot;Start Installation&quot;.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Note:</strong> We recommended moving the error_log.log and the config.inc.php files below the apache document root to be more secure. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
