<h3>System Requirements</h3>
  <dl>
        <dt>What are the system hardware requirements?</dt>
        <dd class="sample1">
          <p>We recommend running Fedora on its own server as it uses its own inbuilt Tomcat webserver. You can configure Tomcat to run on the same server as Apache or IIS but it is complicated (we don't do it). You can run Fedora on Windows or Linux (we use Linux). Fez will run on any server that supports PHP, so IIS or Apache. We run Fez on Apache 1.3.x on Linux (a variant of Red Hat Enterprise 3). We achieve reasonably fast response times (less than a second) for our servers with Fedora and Fez on dual Xeon 2ghz servers with 1 gig of RAM each. The MySQL database server is a similar hardware setup. </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>What are the system software requirements?</dt>
        <dd class="sample1">
          <p>Fedora 2.1b+ must be installed on a server (2.0 will work if you change two Fedora API lines in the Fez config.inc.php file). Visit the Fedora website for details on how to install Fedora. </p>
          <p>The Fez PHP code must be setup on a webserver with PHP 5+. PHP 4 will not be sufficient as Fez uses the DOMDocument object which is only in PHP 5 and upwards. MySQL 4.1+ must also be setup on a server. MySQL 4.0 or lower will not be sufficient as Fez takes advantage of subqueries and other features that were introduced in MySQL 4.1. At UQ Library we run Fedora on its own Linux server with a samba mapped drive to a SAN (storage area network) for storage of non-xml objects like large files. We run the Fez and the Fedora MySQL database on our central MySQL database server. The Fez PHP code is run from a specific web application server (with Apache 1.3.x and PHP 5.0.4). </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
        <dd class="sample1">
          <p><strong>NOTE: See the <a href="install.html">Installation Instructions</a> for full details </strong></p>
          <p>PHP 5 Configuration Details:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The NuSOAP classes come with the Fez code, so the 'soap' extension to PHP does not need to be installed (it hasn't even been tested with Fez, although it may work).</li>
            <li>The php max_file_upload parameter in php.ini should be changed to at least 10megs instead of the default 2megs for file uploads. The higher the max_file_upload parameter the bigger the size of file you can upload into Fez.</li>
            <li>The CURL PHP extenstion must be enabled </li>
            <li>The DOMXML PHP extenstion must be enabled</li>
            <li>The LDAP PHP extenstion must be enabled</li>
            <li>The MySQL 4.1+ libraries must be compiled into PHP</li>
            <li>The Tidy PHP extension must be enabled</li>
            <li>Future versions of Fez will probably require the IMAP and GD PHP extensions as well. </li>
          </ul>
