  <strong>Process impact:</strong> This proposal,
  along with drafts of related documents, will be used by management to
  determine whether or not to approve work on this project.  A clear
  and precise project plan helps set expectations that will be used
  later to evaluate the success of the project.

 <h3>Background and Motivation</h3>

 <div class="todo">
  TODO: Replace the example text below with text that describes your
  project.  What are the needs or problems that you are trying to
  address?  Why do these needs (still) exist?  Why are these problems
  worth solving?  Who is the customer?  Write 2-4 paragraphs. 
 </div>

 <dl> 

  <dt>What is the setting and history behind this project?</dt> 
 
  <dd class="sample1">The University of Queenland Library has various a number of existing digital repositories in various states which contain numerous collections of data. Many of these systems overlap in functionality but have some specific nuance according to the type of data stored within. It has long be wished for a central digital repository to replace the multiple number of systems that can offer more of the functionality and lessen the amount of administration and maintenance currently carried out.</dd>


  <dt>What is the problem to be addressed?</dt> 
  
  <dd class="sample1">The need for a central digital repository to contain collections of records of very different material in a sustainable way. </dd>


  <dt>What are some current approaches to this problem?</dt> 
 
  <dd class="sample1">There are many open source digital repository software packages
available yet these are the main competitors to Fedora:
    <ul>
   <li><a href="http://www.dspace.org">DSpace</a></li>
   <li><a href="http://www.eprints.org">ePrints</a> (Aimed more towards scholarly publishing)</li>
   </ul>
  </dd>
  <dd class="sample1"></dd>
  <dd class="sample1">There are also some existing FEDORA web interfaces in various stages of functionality and availability:</dd>
  <dd class="sample1">
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://elated.sourceforge.net/">Elated</a> (JSP)</li>
        <li>Cornell CMS (not ready for general distribution at this time) (PHP)</li>
        <li>New Jersey Workflow Managment System (no announced plans to make generally available - see <a href="http://www.scc.rutgers.edu/fedora_conf_2005/program.html">Fedora Conference 2005</a> abstracts)</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
 </dl>
 <dl>
   <dt>Why is this problem worth solving or worth solving better?</dt>
   <dd class="sample1">None of the existing solutions offer the full required functionality or flexibility eSpace will provide. </dd>
   <dt>How will this product be better than previous approaches?</dt>
   <dd class="sample1">We add innovative new features.  Our system will have similar functionality, but
      it will have much better maintainability, scalability, and
      security.</dd>
   <dt>Where is there more information on this problem?</dt>
   <dd>The following pages provide additional background and
      motivation:

 <h3>Goal</h3>
 <dl>

  <dt>What is the goal of this project?</dt>
 
  <div class="tip">
   TIP: This should be relatively short since you can reference terms
   defined above.
  </div>
 
  <dd class="sample1">This project will produce an engine for clan
  directory websites that allows players to quickly find, evaluate,
  and join clans.</dd>
 
 
  <dt>What are the defining features and benefits of this product?</dt>
 
  <dd>
  <ul class="sample1">
   <li>Reusable website engine with functionality for creating,
   editing, deleting, searching, categorizing, browsing, rating, and
   commenting on clans.  This automates all clan operations and ensures
   that users will always find information that is automatically
   up-to-date.</li>
 
   <li>The reusable website engine will have a highly configurable
   appearance that allows it to match the look and feel of the game.
   This allows the reusable website engine to have a high-quality
   appearance that is just as good as existing clan directories.</li>
 
   <li>The website engine will be secure and only allow users with the
   proper permissions to edit, delete, or join a clan.  This will
   prevent cheating or the submission of false information.</li>
  </ul>
  </dd>


  <dt>Where are other documents that further explain the goal of this
  project?</dt>

 <h3>Scope</h3>
 <div class="todo">
  TODO: Replace the sample text below with a clear statement of the
  scope of your project.  What are the high-level things that you plan
  to do, and that you will not do?  What are your important
  simplifying assumptions?  Try to guard against reasonable
  misunderstandings that might arise if you did not explain the scope.
  It can take the form of a paragraph, bullet list, in/out list, and/or
  UML context diagram.

 and the features of that application that help build a good gaming
 community.</p>

  <li>The web site content discusses a game, but it will not need to

 <h3>Risks and Rewards</h3>

  <div class="todo">
   TODO: Briefly list and rank major risks.  Risks are detailed in the
   draft <a href="plan.html">project plan</a>.  For this proposal
   document, you should select the most important risks from the
   project plan and explain them in non-technical terms.
  </div>

  <dt>What are the main risks of this project?</dt>
 
  <dd class="sample1">
   <ol>
    <li>There is a potential conflict between the goals of a
    high-quality appearance and one that is completely customizable.  We
    can only succeed if players find the web site appealing, and game
    vendors can customize it with no more effort than would be needed to
    build a static website.  We already have a design in mind that will
    address this risk and we will review it with a web site designer who
    worked for a game vendor site.</li>
  
    <li>There are significant technical difficulties in building a web
    site and web application.  This will be a risk because one person on
    our team has much experience with the relevant tools and
    technologies.  Although the others will learn, we will certainly
    make some mistakes and suboptimal choices.  We will address this
    risk by scoping the project such that we have enough time to train
    and to review the design and implementation.</li>
  
    <li>The schedule for this project is very short.  We will manage
    this by planning a conservatively scoped functional core and series
    of functional enhancements that can be individually slipped to later
    releases if needed.</li>
   </ol>
  </dd>

 
  <dt>What are the main rewards if this project succeeds?</dt>

  <dd class="sample1">If we accomplish the elements of our plan, our
  clan directory website engine will replace existing clan directory
  websites and generate traffic which will result in advertising
  revenue and/or hosting fees paid by game vendors.  Our ability to
  overcome the challenges above will determine time to market, the
  speed of adoption, the amount of web traffic, and thus the generated
  revenue over time.</dd>
