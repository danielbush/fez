  <strong>Process impact:</strong> The SRS
  precisely defines the software product that will be built.  Decisions
  made in writing the SRS are based on information in the <a
  href="proposal.html">project proposal</a> and <a
  href="user-needs.html">user needs</a> documents.  The SRS sets
  requirements that must be satisfied by the <a
  href="design.html">system design</a>.  The SRS is verified and
  validated by activities outlined in the <a href="qa-plan">QA
  plan</a>.

 <div id="introduction">
 <h3>Introduction</h3>



 <p>This 0.1.0 release of eSpace will have what we deem as basic functionality required by a digital repository. Future releases will cover more advanced functionality and offer features made available by newer versions of Fedora. </p>

 <p>For more information, see the project <a
 href="proposal.html">proposal</a>.</p>
 </div> <!-- /introduction -->



 <div id="usecases">
 <h3>Use Cases</h3>

 <p>eSpace 0.1.0 will be used by a select group of Communities and Collections. The UQ Library will be the initial primary user for Collections such as meeting notes, Fryer Findaids, image collections. </p>

 <p>Details:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Actors are described in the <a href="user-needs.html">user
  needs</a> document.</li>
  
  <li>The <a href="use-case-suite.html">use case suite</a> lists all
  use cases in an organized way.</li>

 </ul>

 <h3>Functional Requirements</h3>

 <p>Details:</p>

 <ul>
  <li>The <a href="feature-set.html">feature set</a> lists all
   features in an organized way.</li>
 </ul>
 </div> <!-- /functional -->

 <div id="nonfunctional">
 <h3>Non-Functional Requirements</h3>


 <dl>

  <dt>What are the usability requirements?</dt>

  <dd>
   Easy to use for non-technical researchers. The interface should be intuitive and un-cluttered.</dd>
<dd>Researchers should be able to get to their data easily and have a feeling of control over their research data
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl>  <dt>What are the security requirements?</dt>

  <dd>
   <p>Access will be controlled with usernames and passwords via LDAP or internally via MySQL MD5 hashes. </p>

   <p>Only administrator users will have access to administrative
   functions, average users will not.</p>

   <p>Details:</p>

   <ul>
    <li>We use encrypted communications (SSL) for this website, especially on login screens.</li>
    <li>User data is stored in sessions, not cookies or query params.  </li>
   </ul>

 <h3>Environmental Requirements</h3>

 <dl>
  <dt>What are the system hardware requirements?</dt>

  <dd >
   The system must be supported by the Linux operating system - this leaves a wide array of processor
 architectures and computer components. The system must be able to comfortably run a web server so will
 need to be relatively modern with ample RAM, e.g. a small cluster of P4 with 1GB RAM each. 
  </dd>
  <dd>The biggest requirement will be for storage, enough for all the research data, which will likely 
approach 1TB after the system has run for a couple of years. A fibre link to a SAN is the planned method. 
In the short term, a large capacity SATA hard-disk should suffice. </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt>What are the system software requirements?</dt>

  <dd >
   In order for material in eSpace to be as accessible as possible, thus
     guaranteeing the widest possible research impact worldwide, all software used in
     the project will be open source. eSpace will be a Web-accessible set
     of databases, built upon the Linux operating system, using a mySQL database
     with Perl and PHP as the programming languages. It will comply with a number of
     Australian and international standards, such as the Open Archives Initiative, for
     open access collections; enhanced Dublin Core, for metadata; the OpenURL
     standard, for long-term linking and access; and the Australian Standard Research
     Classification, as a subject thesaurus. The use of XML as a format for data
     exchange will also be investigated.
  </dd>
</dl><dl>
  <dt>What are the data import and export requirements?</dt>

  <dd >
   <p>The objects in Fedora will be accessable via the Fedora <a href="glossary.html#oai-pmh" class="def">OAI-PMH</a> Service 
Provider to authenticated OAI-PMH Harvesters. Objects can be imported (or ingested) into
 Fedora as long as they are in  <a href="glossary.html#foxml" class="def">FOXML</a> or <a href="glossary.html#mets" class="def">METS</a> format XML files. Entire folders of these 
XML files can be ingested into Fedora through the Fedora Administrator GUI client by eSpace 
administrators. eSpace may have a batch import function in a future version so non-administrators 
can import objects this way. </p>

   <p>Details:</p>

   <ul>
    <li>The system will store all data in Fedora. </li>

    <li>The system will store all data in XML format, using FOXML.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
