  <strong>Process impact:</strong> The SRS
  precisely defines the software product that will be built.  Decisions
  made in writing the SRS are based on information in the <a
  href="proposal.html">project proposal</a> and <a
  href="user-needs.html">user needs</a> documents.  The SRS sets
  requirements that must be satisfied by the <a
  href="design.html">system design</a>.  The SRS is verified and
  validated by activities outlined in the <a href="qa-plan">QA
  plan</a>.

 <h3>Introduction</h3>



 <p>This 0.1.0 release of eSpace will have what we deem as basic functionality required by a digital repository. Future releases will cover more advanced functionality and offer features made available by newer versions of Fedora. </p>

 <p>For more information, see the project <a
 href="proposal.html">proposal</a>.</p>

 <div id="usecases">
 <h3>Use Cases</h3>

 <p>eSpace 0.1.0 will be used by a select group of Communities and Collections. The UQ Library will be the initial primary user for Collections such as meeting notes, Fryer Findaids, image collections. </p>

 <p>Details:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Actors are described in the <a href="user-needs.html">user
  needs</a> document.</li>
  
  <li>The <a href="use-case-suite.html">use case suite</a> lists all
  use cases in an organized way.</li>

  <dt>What are the usability requirements?</dt>

  <dd class="sample1">
   <p>Our main criteria for making the system usable is the difficulty
   of performing each high-frequency use case.  Difficulty depends on
   the number of steps, the knowledge that the user must have at each
   step, the decisions that the user must make at each step, and the
   mechanics of each step (e.g., typing a book title exactly is hard,
   clicking on a title in a list is easy).</p>
  
   <p>The user interface should be as familiar as possible to users
   who have used other web applications and Windows desktop
   applications.  E.g., we will follow the UI guidelines for naming
   menus, buttons, and dialog boxes whenever possible.
   </p>

  <dd class="sample1">&nbsp;</dd>


  <dt>What are the security requirements?</dt>

  <dd class="sample1">
   <p>Access will be controlled with usernames and passwords via LDAP or internally via MySQL MD5 hashes. </p>

   <p>Only administrator users will have access to administrative
   functions, average users will not.</p>

   <p>Details:</p>

   <ul>
    <li>We use encrypted communications (SSL) for this website for login screens </li>
    </ul>

 <h3>Environmental Requirements</h3>

 <dl>

  <dt>What are the system hardware requirements?</dt>

  <dd class="sample1">


   <p>We recommend running Fedora on its own server as it uses its own inbuilt Tomcat webserver. You can configure Tomcat to run on the same server as Apache or IIS but it is complicated (we don't do it). You can run Fedora on Windows or Linux (we use Linux). eSpace will run on any server that supports PHP, so IIS or Apache. We run eSpace on Apache 1.3.x on Linux (a variant of Red Hat Enterprise 3). We achieve reasonably fast response times (less than a second) for our servers with Fedora and eSpace on dual Xeon 2ghz servers with 1 gig of RAM each. The MySQL database server is a similar hardware setup. </p>

   </dd>


  <dt>What are the system software requirements?</dt>

  <dd class="sample1">
   <p>Fedora 2.0+ must be installed on a server. Visit the Fedora website for details on how to install Fedora. </p>

   <p>The eSpace PHP code must be setup on a webserver with PHP 5+. PHP 4 will not be sufficient as eSpace uses the DOMDocument object which is only in PHP 5 and upwards. MySQL 4.1+ must also be setup on a server. MySQL 4.0 or lower will not be sufficient as eSpace takes advantage of subqueries and other features that were introduced in MySQL 4.1. At UQ Library we run Fedora on its own Linux server with a samba mapped drive to a SAN (storage area network) for storage of non-xml objects like large files. We run the eSpace and the Fedora MySQL database on our central MySQL database server. The eSpace PHP code is run from a specific web application server (with Apache 1.3.x and PHP 5.0.4). </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dd class="sample1">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>PHP 5 Configuration Details:</p>
    <ul>
          <li>The NuSOAP classes come with the eSpace code, so the 'soap' extension to PHP does not need to be installed (it hasn't even been tested with eSpace, although it may work).</li>
          <li>The php max_file_upload parameter in php.ini should be changed to at least 12megs instead of the default 2megs for file uploads. The higher the max_file_upload parameter the bigger the size of file you can upload into eSpace.</li>
          <li>The CURL PHP extenstion must be enabled </li>
          <li>The DOMXML PHP extenstion must be enabled</li>
          <li>The LDAP PHP extenstion must be enabled</li>
          <li>The MySQL 4.1+ libraries must be compiled into PHP</li>
          <li>The Tidy PHP extension must be enabled</li>
          <li>Future versions of eSpace will probably require the IMAP and GD PHP extensions as well. </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dd class="sample1">&nbsp;</dd>


  <dt>What are the data import and export requirements?</dt>

  <dd class="sample1">
   <p>The objects in Fedora will be able to be accessed via the Fedora OAI-PMH Service Provider to authenticated OAI-PMH Harvesters. Objects can be imported (or ingested) into Fedora as long as they are in  FOXML or METS format XML files. Entire folders of these XML files can be ingested into Fedora through the Fedora Administrator GUI client by eSpace administrators. eSpace may have a batch import function in a future version so non-administrators can import objects this way. </p>

   <p>Details:</p>

   <ul>
    <li>The system will store all data in Fedora. </li>

    <li>The system will store all data in XML format, using FOXML.</li>
    </ul>
