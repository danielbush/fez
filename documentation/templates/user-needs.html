  <strong>Process impact:</strong> The statement of
  user needs documents and explains the actual desires of stakeholders
  in roughly their own words.  What they <i>desire</i> is never exactly
  what the product <i>provides</i>.  Documenting user needs here,
  independently from the <a href="srs.html">SRS</a>, helps to keep the
  SRS precise and makes the tasks of verification and validation more
  effective.  This document is <em>not</em> an informal draft of the
  SRS, it is different document with a complementary purpose.

 <div id="agreedgoals">
 <h3>Agreed Goals</h3>
<dl>
 <ul>
   <li>Provide a repository for all UQ Research data. The repository feature set will be attractive
 to potential users of the system so that they will prefer eSpace to their current ad-hoc repositories 
(such as personal web-sites and file shares).</li>
   <li>Research data to be stored sustainably - i.e. descriptions of file formats and information 
needed to view the data in the future should be stored. </li>
   <li>Easy to store, retrieve and link to data.</li>
   </ul>

</dl>
 </div> 
 <div id="environment">
   <h3>Environment</h3>

   <dl>

  <dt>What is the system's business environment?</dt>
  <dd> UQ wants research generated by the university available outside of the university to increase
 contribution to academic research (and ultimately attract more funding and researchers). Researchers 
want to give other researchers access to their work for purposes of peer review and citation to help 
build their career and attract funding to their area of research.</dd>

  <dt>What is the system's physical environment?</dt>
  <dd>eSpace is a web application. The servers will be located in the UQ Library LTS server room. The 
actual repository will be part of the LTS <a href="glossary.html#san" class="def">SAN</a>.</dd>

  <dt>What is the system's technology environment (hardware and software)?</dt>

  <dd>eSpace will mostly build on and use open source software. This includes Linux Operating System,
 Apache Web Server, MySQL Database, PHP Web Scripting Language and Fedora Digital Repository. The system 
will make use of open standards and file formats as much as possible such as XML and standard XML formats
 such as XSD, RDF, OAI and Dublin Core. Part of the sustainability requirement is that the system shouldn't 
rely on proprietary software and systems which may become unavailable in the future.</dd>

  <dd>The software will run on rack mounted web server hardware making use of a fibre network connection
 to the SAN and internet. </dd>
  <dd>Most users will be using personal computers running a web browser to access the repository. </dd>

  <dd>The repository may also be accessed via a web service interface to integrate with external 
repositories in partnership with UQ. </dd>

 <h3>User Stories</h3>

 <dl >
  
  <dt >Researcher Uploads Data </dt>

  <dd>Reg has heard that eSpace is the way to go because many more people can find and use her research and she can keep track of statistics on how and where it's being used. She decides to check it out. An email she received about it has a link to eSpace. She clicks on it and sees the eSpace front page. She sees a clear link to a section inviting her to put her research into eSpace. She logs in using her UQ username and password just like when she reads her webmail. </dd>
  <dd>It is easy for her to follow the instructions to put her files into espace and create notes about what is in the files. The system fills in a lot of the information automatically and remembers information she typed before. She uploads some papers she's written and some tabulated data from surveys she conducted. The interface clearly shows that as she puts the research in, she is making a personal eSpace which she can get to at anytime by clicking 'My eSpace' in the main menu.</dd>

 <dt>Researcher Checks Statistics </dt>
   <dd>When Rod views his personal eSpace homepage, he sees the most recent research data he has added but can page through and view the older items he has submitted as well. Next to each item he quickly sees how many downloads it has had and sees links for doing common work on the items such as updating them.</dd>
   <dd>Each item has an obvious link that lets him share his research - he can click to email an item link to a colleague or generate a citation reference that he can use in a bibliography.</dd>
   <dd>Rod's eSpace homepage also has a recent-comments link where he can see comments that people have left about his research. He can configure his account so that he is emailed when someone comments on his espace items. </dd>

   <dt>Researcher Organises Research</dt>
   <dd>Reg wants to group her research into categories. Apart from the dublin core meta data, she can put a tag of any descriptive word she likes. She tags some of her research material as relating to various subjects she teaches. She can then click on a list of tags that will show the items. Later she tags some of her research as useful for a conference talk she is presenting. She can have as many tags as she likes on an item so that some of the ones that have tags for subjects are also tagged for her conference presentation.</dd>
   <dt>Viewer Researches a Topic </dt>
  <dd>Vincent is working on literature review about a topic. He searches for keywords in eSpace and finds a result with several promising leads. He bookmarks the search and tries another. When he searches, he can add special words and symbols into the search to build boolean searches that are restricted to certain fields e.g. dublin core fields like title, creator, subject etc... combining them with 'and', 'or' and 'not' operators. He bookmarks several searches.</dd>
  <dd>As Vincent views the research material that he found in his search, he annotates the documents in eSpace. His annotations are private and he can review a list of his annotations later. He also visits the eSpace profiles of some of the authors to see what other research they have published. He annotates his thoughts on some of the authors. When he annotates a research paper or author, the items are bookmarked in his private eSpace. </dd>
  <dd>Vincent puts some tags on the items he finds to help himself and others find them later. He tags them with his topic of interest. On some of the items, he writes a public comment summarising his thoughts on the research. Others have left comments about some of the research, informally reviewing it, noting limitations or assumptions made by the author or commending it's strengths which Vincent finds useful to evaluate whether the documents and data are useful to him. </dd>

<dt>Researcher Restricts Permissions</dt>
<dd>Rod's research group are working on a project that is not ready for publication but they would like to share it with each other. They decide to put it in eSpace so their colleagues in Antarctica can review the research material and comment on it through eSpace and they all can access the discussion. They set up a collection in eSpace and use a form to set permissions on the collection as a whole so that only their group can see it. They also change the permissions so that their corporate partners can view the collection but make no changes. </dd>

<dt>Reviewer Checks Some Research</dt>
<dd>Cheryl logs into eSpace and sees that there are a number of submissions to be reviewed.  She clicks on each one in turn and follows the workflow instructions, these include checking the meta-data, making sure the files are readable and conform to the correct standards. When she is happy with a research item, she clicks a button to progress the item to the next stage of the workflow. For one of the items, the document contains a diagram written in an unknown application. She clicks to assign the research item to the administrator who deals with the problem of  convincing the author to save in a different format or adding support for the format if it is an open standard.</dd>

<dt>Administrator Adds Meta-Data Options</dt>
<dd>The entomology department would like eSpace to support an XML based  format that describes noises that crickets make (BugML). The format is described by an XSD file. The Entomology research group would like to add a collection of cricket recordings they made on Morton Island. Adam goes to the eSpace administration page and adds the XSD file to the accepted format for eSpace. He then configures how the form to make a BugML file will be displayed. The web interface allows him to link the fields from the XSD file to HTML form elements such as drop down boxes and text fields. He is able to place constraints on the fields so that the entry form will check the validity when the researchers are uploading their data later. Adam doesn't have to do any programming and the system automatically sets up the form from the XSD file so he only has to tweak it here or there.</dd>

 <div id="capacity">
 <h3>Performance and Capacity Needs</h3>

 <p>At this stage we don't know what the capacity of the system will be. A gross estimate is about 300GB per year with about 200 new authors per year (after the initial sign-up of maybe 2000 authors).</p>
 <p>Traffic to the site will vary according to student and acedemic interest and may surge with media attention to research or after large conferences. </p>
