  <dt>What problem does this project address?</dt>

  <dd>The project addresses the lack of a suitable freely available and open-source web based Digital Repository, specifically for use in Libraries. </dd>

  <dt>What is the goal of this project?</dt>

  <dd>
    <p>To provide a sustainable web based digital repository for research documents and data at the University of Queensland Library.</p>
    <p>Fez is an open source project to produce and maintain a highly flexible web interface to <a href="http://www.fedora.info/">FEDORA</a> for any Library or Insituition to configure and publish or archive documents of any type sustainably.</p>

 <dt>What makes this product different from others?</dt>

 <dd>This is an open source project that you are welcome to use for
 free and help make better.  Existing freely available and open-source web interfaces to FEDORA are few and limited in functionality.</dd>

 <dd>This system has been designed to be as flexible as possible. </dd>

 </dl>

 <dt>Is this project part of a larger effort?</dt>

 <dd>
  Yes.  It is part of the <a href="http://www.apsr.edu.au/">Australian Partnership for Sustainable Repositories</a> (APSR). Fez is one of the deliverables of the APSR <a href="http://www.library.uq.edu.au/escholarship">eScholarship</a> testbed in the <a href="http://www.library.uq.edu.au/">University of Queensland Library</a>. </dd>

 <h3>Status</h3>
<dl>
 <dt>What is the status of this project?</dt>
